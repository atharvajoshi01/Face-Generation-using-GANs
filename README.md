# Face Generation
## Project Overview
This project focuses on generating realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal is to train a GAN model to generate new images that resemble human faces based on a given dataset of celebrity images.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files from the Project Workspace.

#### Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Project Files
The project files include the following:

1. dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and instructions.
2. README.md: This file contains project information and instructions.
3. requirements.txt: File specifying the required Python dependencies.
4. tests.py: Python script for running project tests.
5. processed-celeba-small.zip: Dataset file (zip format) containing preprocessed celebrity face images.
   
### Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the project.
3. The project is organized into different sections: Data Pipeline, Model Implementation, Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty, and Training Loop.
4. Make design decisions based on your experience and implement the necessary code in each section.
5. Feel free to iterate and improve your model or data pipeline based on the results obtained.

### Acknowledgments
• This project was completed as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree program on Udacity.

• The dataset used for training the GAN model is derived from the CelebA dataset.

• The project instructions and starter code were provided by Udacity.
